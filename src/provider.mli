(** Parametrize your OCaml library with values that behave like objects but
    aren't.

    A "provider" is a construct that implements a set of methods that an
    library typically needs in order to provide certain functionality to a
    client.

    The module is divided into several submodules:
    - {!module:Class_id}: To identify classes.
    - {!module:Class}: For implementing classes.
    - {!module:Interface}: Manages the set of classes that an object implements.
    - {!module:Private}: Used for testing purposes.

    This module is inspired by the [Eio.Resource] module and provides a way to
    parameterize code when a library either doesn't want to or can't commit to a
    specific implementation. *)

module Class_id : sig
  (** Identifying a class within the provider system.

      - ['t] is the internal state of the provider itself.
      - ['implementation] is the API that can be requested.
      - ['tag] is the tag (or tags) indicating the supported class. It's a
        phantom type designed to make {!val:Interface.lookup} more type-safe.

      The API requested is expected to be a module type (Eio supports single
      functions but this is discouraged through the use of this library). *)
  type ('t, 'implementation, 'tag) t = ..

  (** {1 Dump & debug} *)

  module Info : sig
    (** This type is primarily used for debugging purposes.

        An [t] value includes the name of the class constructor and the module
        path where it was defined. It may also include the runtime id for the
        extensible variant of the class id, but this is not included by default
        as its value can be brittle (it may depend on the order in which modules
        are evaluated).

        This type provides a way to retrieve and display detailed information
        about a class, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the
        structure and behavior of the provider system. *)

     of exposing the [same_witness*] functions here. The type parameter [t']

     creates an issue given the [Obj.magic] in the implementation. Revisit. *)

      handling of the tags happens at the interface building stage, not at the
      granularity of each class. This means that the [implement] function
      focuses solely on creating the class, without considering the tags that
      indicate which classes are supported by the provider. *)
  val implement : class_id:('t, 'implementation, _) Class_id.t -> 'implementation -> 't t

  (** {1 Dump & debug} *)

  val uid : _ t -> Class_id.Uid.t
  val info : _ t -> Class_id.Info.t
end

module Interface : sig
  (** Manipulating the set of classes implemented by a provider.

      This module provides functions for creating an interface, as well as
      retrieving and extending the classes implemented by an interface, making
      it easy to manage the functionalities that a provider supports. *)

  (** An interface is essentially a collection of classes that an object
      implements, each of which providing a specific set of functionalities
      (one class = one first-class module with type t = 't).

      - ['t] is the internal state of the provider.
      - ['tags] indicate which functionality are supported by the provider. It
        is a phantom type using polymorphic variants. To give an example, in the
        tests for this library, we have two modules defining each their own tag:

      {[
        module Directory_reader = struct
          type tag = [ `Directory_reader ]
        end

        module File_reader = struct
          type tag = [ `File_reader ]
        end
      ]}

      Then, the type of the interface for a provider whose internal state is
      [state], that would implement both functionalities would be:

      {[
        (state, [ Directory_reader.tag | File_reader.tag ]) Provider.Interface.t
      ]} *)
  type ('t, -'tags) t

  (** {1 Building interfaces} *)

  (** [make classes] create a new interface from a list of classes. It only
      keeps the last occurrence of each class. This means that the resulting
      interface will not contain any duplicate classes, and the order of the
      classes in the input list can affect its contents. *)
  val make : 't Class.t list -> ('t, _) t

  (** [classes t] returns a list of classes that the interface [t]
      implements. See also {!extend}. *)
  val classes : ('t, _) t -> 't Class.t list

  (** [extend t ~with_] extends the interface [t] and returns a new interface
      that includes both the original and additional classes. The resulting
      interface only contains the last occurrence of each class identifier,
      prioritizing the rightmost elements in the combined list
      [classes t @ with_]. *)
  val extend : ('t, _) t -> with_:'t Class.t list -> ('t, _) t

  (** {1 Lookup}

      A lookup operation is used to retrieve the implementation of a specific
      class within an interface based on its class identifier. *)

  (** [is_empty t] checks if an interface [t] implements any classes. An empty
      interface may be created using [make []]. It will cause any lookup
      operation to fail. It can be useful for initializing data structures or
      providing a base case for algorithms that process interfaces. *)
  val is_empty : ('t, _) t -> bool

  (** [lookup t ~class_id] retrieves the implementation for a given class from
      an interface.

      If the provider has correctly exported their implementation using the
      appropriate tags, the compiler will ensure that this function does not
      fail in user code (a failure of this function would typically indicate a
      programming error in the provider's setup). *)
  val lookup
    :  ('t, 'tags) t
    -> class_id:('t, 'implementation, 'tags) Class_id.t
    -> 'implementation

  (** [lookup_opt t ~class_id] returns the implementation of the class
      ([Some implementation]) or indicates that the class is not implemented
      ([None]).

      This is particularly useful in scenarios where a part of a program needs
      to adapt behavior at runtime based on whether certain functionalities are
      available or not. *)
  val lookup_opt
    :  ('t, _) t
    -> class_id:('t, 'implementation, _) Class_id.t
    -> 'implementation option

  (** [implements t ~class_id] says wether an interface implements a class. This
      is [true] iif [lookup_opt t ~class_id] returns [Some _]. *)
  val implements : ('t, _) t -> class_id:('t, _, _) Class_id.t -> bool
end

(** A provider is a pair of a value and an interface for it. Think about [t] as
    the internal state of an object, and [interface] as the set of methods
    that the object implements. *)
type -'tags t =
  | T :
      { t : 't
      ; interface : ('t, 'tags) Interface.t
      }
      -> 'tags t

module Private : sig
  (** This module is exported for testing purposes only.

      Its interface may change in breaking ways without requiring a major
      version of the library to be minted. Use at your own risk. *)

        interfaces are the same and in the same order. *)

        up class. Currently returns [None] for empty interface, and if the
        interface is not empty, returns the most recently looked up class
        ([Some uid]) or an arbitrary initial value. *)
